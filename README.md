# flexiManage Controller (Modernized & Self-Hosted Fork)

This repository is a modernized, self-hosted fork of the official [flexiWAN](https://flexiwan.com/) `flexiManage` backend service, updated for compatibility with modern Node.js runtimes and MongoDB engines.

---

## 🚀 Key Modernization Changes

This fork resolves major breaking changes present in the legacy release:
* **Node.js v22 Runtime**: Updated backend scripts to run seamlessly on modern Node v22.x releases.
* **Mongoose v6/v7+ Refactoring**: Fixed breaking schema population changes by refactoring 11 instances of `.execPopulate()` across model handlers.
* **Streamlined Local Auth & Mailer Bypass**: Bypassed strict SMTP verification requirements for local/homelab deployment testing.
* **Submodule Cleanups**: Removed dead/private GitLab submodules (`client`, `backend/billing`, `vpnportal`) to prevent broken git pull loops.
* **NGINX Integration**: Configured NGINX reverse proxy support for secure SSL termination and routing.

---

## ⚠️ Submodules & Web UI Notes

The original flexiWAN repository relied on closed/private GitLab submodules for SaaS Billing and UI components:
* `client` - Web UI repository
* `backend/billing` - SaaS billing module
* `vpnportal` - VPN portal extension

These submodules point to private GitLab endpoints and are **not required** to run the backend API controller. Static frontend assets, if built, are served directly from `backend/public/`.

---

## 🛠️ System Requirements & Prerequisites

Ensure the host environment meets the following requirements:

* **Node.js**: `v22.x` (or newer)
* **npm**: `v10.x` (or newer)
* **MongoDB**: `v8.0+` (or standard MongoDB instance/replica set running on port `27017`)
* **Redis**: `v6.0+` (running on port `6379`)
* **Web Server**: NGINX (optional, recommended as reverse proxy on port 80/443)

Verify core database services are active before starting:
```bash
systemctl status mongod redis

# flexiManage

This repository contains the flexiManage backend component from flexiWAN. flexiManage service is used for managing [flexiEdge devices](https://docs.flexiwan.com/overview/arch.html#flexiedge). It allows users to create users and accounts and manage the entire network inventory of the organizations in the account.

Our hosted service https://manage.flexiwan.com provides a free access to the flexiManage service for a 30 days trial where users can create an account and use up to 5 flexiEdge devices during the free trial. Users may request extension of the trial by contacting our account team (team@flexiwan.com). One account is allowed per company and users are not allowed to open additional accounts in order to gain additional free trials.

## What is included in this repository

The flexiManage backend component provides REST API for managing the flexiWAN network, configuring and connecting to the flexiWAN flexiEdge devices. 
The repository includes two git submodules which are used by the flexiWAN SaaS service and are not open. 

When pulling the flexiManage repository, 
these submodules would be seen as an empty directory:
* client - a git submodule for the flexiWAN SaaS UI. The UI provides the user side logic and design for managing the network. It uses REST to access flexiManage
* backend/billing - a git submodule for managing the flexiWAN SaaS billing

These submodules are not required for running the backend serivce and are used for the UI and Billing additions on top of flexiManage.
To experience the complete flexiWAN system, open a free account on our [hosted system](https://flexiwan.com/pricing).

## Install and use flexiManage locally

### Prerequisites
FlexiManage requires the following to run:
* Node.js v10+
* npm v6+
* MongoDB 4.0.9, running as a replica-set with 3 nodes on ports 27017, 27018, 27019
* Redis 5.0.5, running on port 6379
* A mailer application or trapper of your choice, running on port 1025 (Such as [python mailtrap](https://pypi.org/project/mailtrap/))

### Installing
##### Getting the source code:
```
mkdir flexiManage
cd flexiManage
git clone https://gitlab.com/flexiwangroup/fleximanage.git .
```

##### Installing dependencies:
```
cd backend
npm install
```

### Running
```
npm start
```

### Creating a user
To create your first user, use the procedure below:
1) Register a new user:
```
curl -X POST -k "https://local.flexiwan.com:3443/api/users/register" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"accountName\":\"account\",\"userFirstName\":\"user\",\"userLastName\":\"lastname\",\"email\":\"user@example.com\",\"password\":\"xxxxxxxx\",\"userJobTitle\":\"eng\",\"userPhoneNumber\":\"\",\"country\":\"US\",\"companySize\":\"0-10\",\"serviceType\":\"Provider\",\"numberSites\":\"10\",\"companyType\":\"\",\"companyDesc\":\"\",\"captcha\":\"\"}"
```
2) You should get an email to user@example.com with a verification link. In the verification link, copy the id and t (token) parameters and execute the verification API:
```
curl -X POST -k "https://local.flexiwan.com:3443/api/users/verify-account" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"id\":\"<id parameter in the verification link>\",\"token\":\"<token parameter in the verification link>\"}"
```
3) Execute a login API:
```
curl -X POST -sD - -k "https://local.flexiwan.com:3443/api/users/login" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"username\":\"user@example.com\",\"password\":\"xxxxxxxx\",\"captcha\":\"\"}"
```
Check the response header and use the Refresh-JWT as bearer token for any REST API.
```
Refresh-JWT: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJfaWQiOiI1ZTh...TlNo
```
Check the documentation REST API section for more details.  You can create an access-key for your account API key.
